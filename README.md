# PomodoroApp
Work in Progress - Pomodoro web app  
---
I am currently working on building RedLoop, a customizable and immersive pomodoro timer. Built with C# and .NET Blazor, styled with Blazor Bootstrap, the goal is to create a deep work environment and improve user performance in any task!

# Why RedLoop?
The Pomodoro Method can and should be more than a timer, and I aim to build a tool that fills in the gaps that the classic kitchen timer or stop watch is missing. RedLoop features: 

‚è±Ô∏èCustomizable work/break intervals to suit your work style.

üéµAmbient sounds and background music to keep you locked in to your task, and signals for when it's time for that well-earned break!

üïØÔ∏èVisualizations that give an ambiance of calm to make chaotic work feel less chaotic.


## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Keep an eye on this repo, there is plenty in the works to expand it!  

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Core Pomodoro timer functionality (start/pause/reset)
- Configurable work/break durations
- Persistent settings via local storage
- Cycle tracking with optional goal
- Floating timer across pages
- Motivational and break messages
- Ambient sound, music, and chime effects
- Background visual  
- Persistent background/music across all pages
- Contact form with email delivery (via Formspree)

### üõ†Ô∏è In Progress

- Sound settings toggle (enable/disable music & effects)
- Fade-in audio transitions
- Responsive design polish

### üöÄ Upcoming Ideas

- Move large assets to CDN or cloud storage
- CI/CD pipeline with testing
- Optional user accounts
