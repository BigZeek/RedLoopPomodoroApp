I am currently working on building RedLoop, a customizable and immersive pomodoro timer. Built with C# and .NET Blazor, styled with Blazor Bootstrap, the goal is to create a deep work environment and improve user performance in any task!

🧠 Why RedLoop?
The Pomodoro Method can and should be more than a timer, and I aim to build a tool that fills in the gaps that the classic kitchen timer or stop watch is missing. RedLoop features: 

⏱️Customizable work/break intervals to suit your work style.

🎵Ambient sounds and background music to keep you locked in to your task, and signals for when it's time for that well-earned break!

🕯️Visualizations that give an ambiance of calm to make chaotic work feel less chaotic.
