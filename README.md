# PomodoroApp
---
This is RedLoop, a customizable and immersive pomodoro timer. Built with C# and .NET Blazor WebAssembly and styled with Blazor Bootstrap, the goal is to create a deep work environment and improve user performance in any task!

# Why RedLoop?
The Pomodoro Method can and should be more than a timer, and I aim to build a tool that fills in the gaps that the classic kitchen timer or stop watch is missing. RedLoop features: 

‚è±Ô∏èCustomizable work/break intervals to suit your work style.

üéµAmbient sounds and background music to keep you locked in to your task, and signals for when it's time for that well-earned break!

üïØÔ∏èVisualizations that give an ambiance of calm to make chaotic work feel less chaotic.

---
To run RedLoop:
1) Ensure that the proper .NET SDK is downloaded (This version uses .NET 9.0).  
2) Install Blazor Bootstrap: dotnet add package Blazor.Bootstrap  
3) Build and Run with  
     dotnet restore  
     dotnet build  
     dotnet run
